## Hardware Setup

This code example requires [CY8CKIT-028-TFT TFT Display Shield Board](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/tft-display-shield-board-cy8ckit-028-tft). This shield comes with [PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT). It can also be purchased standalone and used with other supported kits.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click on the link from the Quick Panel. 

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created. 

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps.

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work. 

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command. 

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 Secure MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 Secure MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the [Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSoC 6 MCU EmWin TFT" is displayed on the UART terminal.

5. Observe the startup screen with the Cypress logo on the display. Follow the instructions that come on the screen after two seconds. Press the user switch to move between pages.

**Figure 2. Pages Shown in Sequence**

![Figure 2.](images/pagesinsequence.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

This project uses a [CY8CKIT-028-TFT](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/tft-display-shield-board-cy8ckit-028-tft) TFT Display Shield together with a Pioneer Board. The TFT shield has a [Newhaven 2.4″ 320×240 TFT](http://www.newhavendisplay.com/nhd24240320cfctxif-p-8176.html) display with a [Sitronix ST7789](http://www.newhavendisplay.com/appnotes/datasheets/LCDs/ST7789V.pdf) display controller and uses the 8080-Series Parallel Interface.

There are three important parts in this code example:

1. **[emWin](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/emwin) Graphics Library:** The emWin Graphics Library is implemented as a middleware and has all the graphics functions. In this example, the library manages a display buffer and updates it with the pixel data in accordance with the graphics operations performed. See [emWin middleware documentation](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/emwin) on GitHub for understanding the structure of emWin package, supported drivers, and a quick start guide to create and run your first emWin project from scratch. The documentation page also contains configuration details on a wide variety of display drivers provided my emWin. 

2. **[display-tft-st7789v](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/display-tft-st7789v) Library:** The display-tft-st7789v library provides the supporting functions for communicating with the ST7789V TFT controller. The functions in this library control the pin states for the 8-bit parallel interface.

3. **Application Code:** The application code sets up the FreeRTOS task and begins the scheduler. The FreeRTOS task calls the emWin graphics APIs to perform various graphics functions.
