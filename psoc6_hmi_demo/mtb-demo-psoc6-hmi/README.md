# PSoC 6 MCU: HMI Demo

This example demonstrates a simple HMI application using PSoC 6 MCU and CYW43012. The application fetches current date & time, location and weather forecaste from remote HTTP servers. TFT display shows the data fetched from these remote servers and using the CapSense button widget, users can select the data (time or weather) to be dispayed.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox® software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.3  

- Board Support Package (BSP) minimum required version: 2.0.0  

- Programming Language: C  

- Associated Parts: All [PSoC® 6 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/PSoC6) parts

## Supported Toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm® Embedded Compiler v9.3.1 (GCC_ARM) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## Supported Kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012) (CY8CKIT-062S2-43012)


## Hardware Setup

This code example requires [CY8CKIT-028-TFT TFT Display Shield Board](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/tft-display-shield-board-cy8ckit-028-tft). This shield comes with [PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT). It can also be purchased standalone and used with other supported kits.


## Using the Code Example

Dowloand the  *psoc6_hmi_demo* project from GitHub - [link](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Community-Code-Examples/)

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Choose the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 kit from the list shown in the Project Creator – Choose **Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog and click **Next**.

3. Click **Import**.

4. Browse to the location where you downloaded project (./mtb-demo-psoc6-hmi).

5. Select the mtb-demo-psoc6-hmi application and click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

  
For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps.

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work. 

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).


## Operation

1. Configure the Wi-Fi credentials of the Wi-Fi network  `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` to which you want to connect the demo. These macros are defined in the *./mtb-demo-psoc6-hmi/configs/wifi_config.h* file. Note that the Wi-Fi AP should have access to internet.
   
2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. 

5. Observe the startup screen on the display. Once connected to internet, the Wi-Fi status icon turns blue.
6. The display gets updated once the current date & time, location and weather forecast are retrieved from the HTTP servers.
7. Press button 0 (BTN0)  to display the time and button 1 (BTN1) to display the weather forcast.

**Figure 2. Display showing weather forecast**

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.
