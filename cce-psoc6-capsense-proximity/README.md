# PSoC 6 MCU: CapSense Proximity Example

This code example features the CapSense proximity sensor. The proximity sensor controls the brightness of the LED. The code example also demonstrates monitoring CapSense data using the CapSense Tuner GUI tool. This project uses the [CapSense Middleware Library](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense).

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox® software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.3
- Board Support Package (BSP) minimum required version: 2.0.0  
- Programming Language: C  
- Associated Parts: All [PSoC® 6 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/PSoC6) parts

## Supported Toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm® Embedded Compiler v9.3.1 (GCC_ARM) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm compiler v6.11 (ARM)
- IAR C/C++ compiler v8.42.2 (IAR)

## Supported Kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-BLE) (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) - Default value of `TARGET`

## Hardware Setup

This example requires a proximity loop. Create a loop with one of the jumper wires found in the PSoC kit and attach it to J13.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Importing the example application

Please refer to [IMPORT.md](IMPORT.md) for importing the application

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-BLE TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

3. After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. Move a hand slowly closer to the wire loop and confirm that the LED grows brighter.

5. Move a hand slowly away from the wire loop and confirm that the LED gets dimmer.

6. You can also monitor the CapSense data using the CapSense Tuner application as follows:

    **Monitor Data Using CapSense Tuner**

    1. Open CapSense Tuner from the IDE Quick Panel. 
    
        You can also run the CapSense Tuner application standalone from *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file for the respective kit, which is present in the *TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>/{version}/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* or *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS* folder. 

    3. Ensure the kit is in KitProg3 mode. See [Firmware-loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn on how to update the firmware and switch to KitProg3 mode.

    4. In the Tuner application, click **Tuner Communication Setup** or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window that appears, select the I2C checkbox under KitProg3 and configure as follows: 

            I2C Address: 8
            Sub-address: 2-Bytes
            Speed (kHz): 400

    5. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect**.

    6. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start**.

    Under the **Widget View** tab, you can see the prximity widget highlighted in blue color when active. You can also view the sensor data in the **Graph View** tab. 

    The CapSense Tuner can also be used for CapSense parameter tuning, and measuring signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). See the [ModusToolbox CapSense Tuner Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseTuner) (**Help** > **View Help**) and [AN85951 – PSoC 4 and PSoC 6 MCU CapSense Design Guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for more details on selecting the tuning parameters.
