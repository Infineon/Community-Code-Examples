## Code Examples from the Community

This repository contains links to code example generated by our community users. These code examples cover a broad range of Cypress products such as PSoC, USB, WiFi and BT, and across different Cypress IDEs â€“ PSoC Creator, ModusToolbox IDE, and WICED Studio. 

We present this list as a service to our users. Our goal is to give you a one-stop shop for code examples that exist in a variety of places, like GitHub, the [Cypress community code examples](https://community.cypress.com/community/topics/code-examples), or the [IoT Developer Zone](https://community.cypress.com/community/topics/iot-developer-zone), where you can find many more examples, including some of our design contest winners. 

Most examples have all the source files, so even if an example doesn't use your favorite IDE, you can still find good stuff in the source code.

Cypress Semiconductor did not produce these examples, so obviously we can't guarantee any example will work as expected, and we don't provide support for these examples. If you find any issues with an example, please get in touch with the person who created it.

Finally, if you create an example or find one that you think should be listed here, raise an Issue and point us to the example. We'll take a look, and probably add it to the list.

Thanks, and happy coding!
