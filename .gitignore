# This list of files to ignore includes common, tool- or user-specific files that
# are typically not checked into a version control system (VCS). It is a superset
# of such files. You may want to add others, especially if you use a tool not listed
# here. You can remove those that do not apply to you.
#
# The .gitignore file is intended for the git VCS. For another VCS you would specify
# which files to ignore in whatever form your VCS requires. If you do not check your
# code into a VCS, you can ignore the .gitignore file.
