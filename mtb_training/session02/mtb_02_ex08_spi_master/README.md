# PSoC 6 MCU: SPI Master

This example demonstrates the use of SPI (HAL) resource for PSoC® 6 MCU in Master mode. The SPI master is configured to send command packets to control a user LED on the slave. Both the slave and master are on the same device.

## Requirements

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

Use jumper wires to establish a connection between the master and slave on the kit. For the default kit, do the following on the board (verify with *resource_map.h* to find respective pins for other kits):  
1. Connect P6[0] to P9[0].  
2. Connect P6[1] to P9[1].  
3. Connect P6[2] to P9[2].  
4. Connect P6[3] to P9[3].  

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name:** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where application is created.

5. Click **Create** and complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run Cygwin.bat.

3. Import required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import libraries using `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see *Exporting to IDEs* section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board. 

   ### Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer. 
   
   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   ### Using CLI:

   1. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example: 
   
        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the CE title is displayed on the UART terminal.

5. Observe that the kit user LED blinks at 1 Hz.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see *Program and Debug* section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

The Arm® Cortex®-M4 (CM4) MCU controls both the Master and Slave SPI resources. Both these resources are used from the same chip, so that users can test the functionality on a single kit.

The Master sends a packet to the slave with a command to turn ON or turn OFF the user LED. The packets are sent at an interval of 1 second. The slave receives the packet and controls the LED as per the command.

[Table 1](#table-1-application-resources) lists the ModusToolbox resources used in this example, and how they are used in the design.

##### Table 1. Application Resources

| Resource  |  Alias/Object  |    Purpose     |
| :-------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| SPI (HAL) |      mSPI      | Master SPI     |
| SPI (HAL) |      sSPI      | Slave SPI      |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| Debug UART  |
| GPIO (HAL)| CYBSP_USER_LED | LED indication |
