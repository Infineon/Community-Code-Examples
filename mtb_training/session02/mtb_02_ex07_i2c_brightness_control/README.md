## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

This section describes how to set up the  **Bridge Control Panel** (BCP) software for transmitting and receiving data over I2C.

The BCP software is installed automatically as part of the [PSoC Programmer](http://www.cypress.com/psocprogrammer) installation. Follow these steps to configure BCP:

1.  Open BCP from **Start** > **All Programs** > **Cypress** > **Bridge Control Panel** > **Bridge Control Panel**.

2.  Select **KitProg3** under **Connected I2C/SPI/RX8 Ports** (see [Figure 1]()). Note that the PSoC 6 Kit must be connected to the USB port of your computer.

##### Figure 1. Bridge Control Panel

## Operation

The I2C resource in Slave mode accepts command packets to control the intensity of an LED. The I2C Slave updates its read buffer with a status packet in response to the accepted command.

In this example, a host PC running Cypress’ Bridge Control Panel (BCP) software is used as the I2C Master. LED control is implemented using a TCPWM resource (configured as PWM). The intensity of the LED is controlled by changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal.  

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Program the board. 

   ### Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   ### Using CLI:

   1. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example: 
   
        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

        After programming, the application starts automatically.

3.  Configure the BCP software as described in [Software Setup](#software-setup).

4.  In the **Editor** tab of BCP, type the command to send the LED intensity data, and then click **Send**. Observe that the LED turns ON with the specified intensity.

    The command format that is used to write the data to the Slave if BCP is used as the I2C Master is shown below. The symbol ‘SoP’ means ‘start of packet’ and ‘EoP’ means ‘end of packet’.

    | Start for Write | Slave Address | SoP  | LED TCPWM Compare Value | EoP  | Stop |
    |-----------------|---------------|------|-------------------------|------|------|
    | w               | 0x08          | 0x01 | 0x00 to 0xFF            | 0x17 | p    |

    For example, sending the command `w 08 01 FF 17 p` will turn the LED ON with full intensity; sending the command `w 08 01 00 17 p` will turn the LED OFF.

5.  Type the command `r 08 x x x p` to read the status of the write performed.

    The following is the command format to read the status form the Slave’s read buffer. The symbol ‘x’ denotes one byte to read from the Slave’s read buffer. In this example, three bytes are read from the Slave.

    | Start for Read | Slave Address | SoP | LED TCPWM Compare Value | EoP | Stop |
    |----------------|---------------|-----|-------------------------|-----|------|
    | r              | 0x08          | x   | x                       | x   | p    |

    After each command is sent, the status packet must be read from the read buffer of the Slave by sending the `r 08 x x x p` command. If the packet read is in the format `r 08 01 00 17 p`, the status is set as 'success'; if the packet read is `r 08 01 FF 17 p`, the status is set as 'fail' for the command sent by the I2C Master. See [Figure 1](#figure-1-bridge-control-panel) for more information.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see *Program and Debug* section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

This example demonstrates the operation of I2C (HAL) resource for PSoC® 6 MCU in Slave mode using callbacks. The I2C Slave is configured with a 3-byte write buffer, which can be accessed by the I2C Master to write commands. In addition, a 3-byte read buffer is configured to read the status of the Slave by the Master. The BCP software is used as the I2C Master.

The first byte in the write buffer contains the Start of Packet (SoP) value, the next byte contains the LED’s TCPWM compare value, and the third byte in the write buffer is the End of Packet (EoP) value. The Slave updates the Master’s read buffer with the status packet. The first byte of the status packet is SoP, the second byte contains the status where the value 0x00 means success and 0xFF means failure for the command data sent by the Master, and the third byte in the read buffer is EoP.

To control the intensity of the LED, a PWM with a period value of 255 microseconds is used. The duty cycle of the PWM is controlled in firmware and is specified by the I2C Master.

In the callback method, data write and read complete events from the Master are handled through interrupts. I2C HAL APIs are used to configure the resource to act as an I2C Slave, and to configure its relevant interrupts to handle data write and read complete events by the Master.
